# Find-My-Movie
Diving into: Robotic Process Automation

Used UiPath to automate the process of finding a movie online (Popcornflix, in this case).

We just need to enter the movie's name in the 'Input' textfield and leave the rest to the robot, which goes to the website and searches the movie in its database.

If found, it will open a notepad, type in the result saying that the movie has been found and save it in the preferred location. If not, it will display a message box stating the same.

A further extension can include visiting other websites too and collating the results in the notepad file, or preferably sending an email to the user with the help of 'Send Outlook Mail Message' feature.
